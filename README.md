# dotfiles

These dotfiles are designed to strike a good balance between minimalism and great features. 

## âš¡Getting Started

I manage my dotfiles using `chezmoi`. Setting up a new machine can be done by [running one line](https://www.chezmoi.io/quick-start/#set-up-a-new-machine-with-a-single-command).

For my complete setup read [My clean and simple terminal setup](https://ratoru.com/blog/terminal).
