# Wezterm

## Features

- Vim-like keybindings for tab and pane navigation.
- Fancy tab bar that shows a leader indicator, custom tab names, a water reminder, time of day icon, and battery level.
- Pretty font (Iosevka Extended) and theme.
- No useless information.
- I am still working a making it so that one can easily switch color schemes.
